Prompt the user to enter the number of elements they want to store in a dynamic array (vector).
Use a std::vector to store the elements entered by the user.
Allow the user to input the elements of the vector.
Display the elements of the vector.
Include functionality to add a new element to the vector and display the updated vector."
